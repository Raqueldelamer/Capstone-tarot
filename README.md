### Daily Project Log Day 1 

Monday Nov 11, working on menu-nav & header components on storybook and on home.js main page setting the background image for my Capstone Tarot App project. The lack of design control in storybook w tailwind is very limiting and challenging as creative frontend design is very important to me.

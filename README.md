### create tarot-data.json with image links & update Readme.md
### Challenges 

- I am able to fetch the tarot data from the .json file that I added onto the home.js page, but getting the card images from the url has been a challenge.

### Create Wireframe & update Readme.md
### Challenges 

- The tarot api that I was planning on using doesn't include the tarot images so I need to find another tarot api that includes the images of each card.

### Daily Project Log Day 1, Week 1

Monday Nov 11, working on menu-nav & header components on storybook and on home.js main page setting the background image for my Capstone Tarot App project. The lack of design control in storybook w tailwind is very limiting and challenging as creative frontend design is very important to me.

## Next Steps are to create a wireframe on Canva and implement the fetch tarot api that will show a random tarot card spread on my home.js page*

                <p>For my Tarot Capstone project, I designed an interactive tarot card experience that features a one-card spread, 
                    an informative About page, and a Contact page with a form that sends messages via a secure API endpoint. The projectâ€™s 
                    main goal is to provide users with a seamless and engaging tarot reading experience while also allowing them to reach 
                    out through the contact form.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The project began by creating a `tarot-data.json` file, which contains detailed information about each of 
                    the 22 major arcana cards from the Ryder-Waite tarot deck. Since the tarot API I initially planned to use 
                    did not offer image URLs, I decided to build this file myself, including both tarot card images and brief 
                    yet insightful card interpretations.  
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    On the Home page, I use an API endpoint (`api/tarot.js`) to fetch the tarot data locally and display it when
                    users click a "Fetch Tarot Data" button. This dynamic functionality enriches the user experience by presenting 
                    detailed information about each card, along with its image, in a smooth and intuitive interface.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    To enhance the visual appeal and interactivity, I utilized **Tailwind CSS** and Storybook to style key components of the app, such 
                    as the navigation menu, the fetch button, the headers, and a customized Tarot App Icon that I created with <a className="hover:text-yellow-500 font-bold" href="https://iconify.design" target="_blank">iconify.design</a>. 
                    The result is a modern, responsive design that is both aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate..</p>
